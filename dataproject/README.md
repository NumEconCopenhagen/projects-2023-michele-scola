# Data analysis project

My project is titled **COVID DEATHS AND HOSPITAL BEDS** and is about correlation between covid-19 deaths and number of hospital beds by country.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
Funcions can be seen in the [dataproject.py](dataproject.py) file

I have used the **following datasets**:

1. data.csv (*https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv*) 
2. (*https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.BEDS.ZS*)
3. (*https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.POP.DNST*)
