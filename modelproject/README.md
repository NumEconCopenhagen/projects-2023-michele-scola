# Model analysis project

My project is titled **STACKELBERG COMPETITION** and is about Stackelberg economic duopoly model. I solved the model in three different ways: analytically, numerically and numerically with 3 firms (extension).

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).
The functions used in the project can be read in the [modelproject.py](modelproject.py) file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
